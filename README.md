### Hello there! Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen speaking. 👋

I'm an Internet Architect and Performance Marketer from Kingsport, TN.

Currently seeking a remote role with a tech company (preferably a start-up!). 

### Accomplishments and performance metrics:

💻 2,000+ hours of code experience<br/>
💼 B.S. in business (management/marketing)<br/>
🖋️ 10+ years of creative and copywriting experience<br/>
💪 Strong in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Python<br/>
📰 200+ articles published, many of which reached Google's page #1<br/>
📈 Millions of people reached via social media marketing and SEO strategy<br/>
🐕 125 shelter dogs walked and promoted online, 115 of whom found good homes<br/>
🏆 Named "Volunteer of the Month" by the animal shelter (story covered by my hometown newspaper)

As you can see, my greatest strengths are diverse (not to mention powerful as heck when combined together). 

### Based on an abundance of research and reflection, tech jobs that sound like a good fit include:

-Sales Engineer<br/>
-Support Engineer<br/>
-Customer Success Engineer<br/>

Even better, why not let me create my own role that combines all of the above?

Customer Sales, Success, and Support Engineer (CSSSE). You've gotta admit there's a nice ring to it!

More generally, I'm also open to content and online marketing roles that allow me to flex my user engagement and optimization muscles.
