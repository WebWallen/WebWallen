### Thanks for visiting! Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen speaking. 👋

I'm an Internet Architect and Performance Marketer from Kingsport, TN.

Currently seeking a tech role in any of the following states: TN, VA, NC, SC, OH, and UT.

Used the phrase "tech role" instead of "web developer" because my skills extend far beyond web development. 

### Note the short list of accomplishments and performance metrics for an illustration of what I mean.

💻 2,000+ hours of code experience<br/>
💼 B.S. in business (management/marketing)<br/>
🖋️ 10+ years of creative and copywriting experience<br/>
📰 200+ articles and 5 best-selling Amazon Kindle books published<br/>
📈 Millions of people reached via social media marketing and SEO strategy<br/>
🐕 122 shelter dogs walked and promoted online, 113 of whom found good homes<br/>
🏆 Named "Volunteer of the Month" by the animal shelter (story covered by my hometown newspaper)

As you can see, my skills are diverse (not to mention powerful as heck when combined together). 

### Tech roles that would be an ideal fit include:

-Sales Engineer<br/>
-Support Engineer<br/>
-Developer Advocate<br/>
-Technical Evangelist<br/>
-Customer Relationship Management<br/>

That said, I've also seen some front end developer positions that might be a good match.
