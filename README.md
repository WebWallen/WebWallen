### Thanks for visiting! Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen speaking. 👋

I'm an Internet Architect and Performance Marketer from Kingsport, TN.

Currently seeking a tech role with a start-up located in: TN, VA, NC, SC, OH, or UT.

Used the phrase "tech role" instead of "web developer" because my skills extend beyond development. 

### Note the short list of accomplishments and performance metrics for an illustration of what I mean.

💻 2,000+ hours of code experience<br/>
💼 B.S. in business (management/marketing)<br/>
🖋️ 10+ years of creative and copywriting experience<br/>
💪 Strong in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Python<br/>
📰 200+ articles and 5 best-selling Amazon Kindle books published<br/>
📈 Millions of people reached via social media marketing and SEO strategy<br/>
🐕 125 shelter dogs walked and promoted online, 115 of whom found good homes<br/>
🏆 Named "Volunteer of the Month" by the animal shelter (story covered by my hometown newspaper)

As you can see, my greatest skills are diverse (not to mention powerful as heck when combined together). 

### Tech and online marketing roles that would be an ideal fit include:

-Sales Engineer<br/>
-Optimization Analyst<br/>
-Implementation Manager<br/>
